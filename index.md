This is the homepage for this project, it provides an outline of the project and features as well as the progress of its development.

# The plan for this project

UHManoasList is a service that is going to be available for UH Manoa students. Students who have an interest in selling or buying school or campus living related objects would use this service to do just that. This service would be a method for students to sell some things that they think that another student would find useful but no longer need themselves, such as textbooks or a piece of furniture for a dorm room. Similarly it is a method to buy an item you think you might be interested in from sellers of an object of that nature.

# Functionalities of this application

This application is meant sepcifically for UH students, faculty, and staff. Our application will make sure that buyers and sellers fit within these categories and buyers and sellers will connect to the service through their UH credentials. The goods and services being sold on this service should also be relevant to UH students. Transactions must be carried out on-campus, if a seller wants to meet off-campus, that could be a potential red-flag.

 * You will be able to search for goods and services through categories, such as textbooks and furniture among other things.

 * You can recieve notifications through email or text. Users can set up notifications to appear to alert them when an item they are looking for is listed for sale.

 * The system supports photos to pair with items. You can specify images by url or by uploading an image.

 * You can mark content or other users as inappropriate. The admins will look into this case and possibly ban users who violate the Terms of Use.

All of these functionalities are tentative and have not been developed yet, this page will update as progress has been made in development.
